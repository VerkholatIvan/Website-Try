# Website-Try

!!! Before opening the site YOU MUST unzip the file by pressing with right mouse button and select "EXTRACT ALL"!!! <br>

If the conditions will not be met, the website will not work. <br><br><br>



to start interacting with my website open the "index.html" file. <br><br><br>





Plan: <br>
The target audience for this website are people, who have just started or wanted to start their 
learning in Web Development. The users could be students or adults, who just wanted to 
discover some basics. <br>
Some students can have some problems, while learning, so usually they just search for 
information on the Internet. Some of the sites are well-written and convenient and some of them 
don’t, it mostly depends on understanding what is written down and how easy to understand it.
Thus, they will search for appealing by design and amount of information websites. <br><br>


At the start, I had one vision of the website <br>
First sketch of the website:

<br><br>

But after creating the index page, I decided, that the site looks bad, the colors are not matching 
the topic of coding and all in all the page looked empty. Thus, I remade the sketch and started 
from the beginning <br>
Final sketch:

<br><br>

I had a goal to make it appealing and easy to understand. In the end, I changed the color and 
added additional buttons to be more flexible on the site. <br><br><br>

Design <br>
While creating a website, I was curious about the colors. Usually, programming takes a lot of 
time, so people stop working in the late evening or even in the middle of the night. Still, I did not 
like the idea of making my full website dark. Thus, I decided to make the background color a 
slightly muted white and the “aliceblue” color was perfect for that idea. But to make my website 
look good I should have added one more tone. Firstly, it was red, as it was in the first sketches, but the final decision was to use a bit of dark purple color, which will make the site still 
bright but still will refer to the nighttime. <br>
On the pages themselves, there were headers, which tell users in which section are they, the
“back” button, footers, to show the bottom of the site, and some words on the text were 
highlighted to see where the main information stands if it’s a link it is also underlined <br><br><br>

Implementation <br>
Most of the pages have the same way of making except for the home page. The coding started 
with the “index” or the home page. After I started to implement my final site sketch, I added 
three buttons, which led to the various sections. The icons were not downloaded, they were just 
taken from the “Font Awesome” website (https://fontawesome.com/search). It requires just a
certain link in the HTML code, which can be founded just by searching “font awesome CDN”
and the certain class to use the image which I wanted to. One of the challenges, that I faced 
was the animation on the home page, this was the first time I was using CSS in this way. <br>

Next, I had a goal to make my website easy and comfortable to read, so I needed to add some 
highlighted words and place text in the center, also it was necessary to make the code 
examples be the text, so it could be copied, like in all coding websites. All of the explaining 
pages are similar by code, so I think there is no need to explain each of them. <br><br><br>

Testing and Integration <br>
To test the website, I had to read every page several times to see any grammar mistakes, 
change the size of the page to see if the information on it is flexible, and check some JavaScript 
functionality code, by giving the program the wrong inputs for it. <br>

Mostly, there were problems with CSS, such as a small header, and bad position for buttons, 
but most of them were avoided by just some corrections in the “style.css” file. Moreover, the 
calculator had a bug, which showed up, when the user gives letters as the input and the 
program showed “NuN” as a result, so by just adding “if else” commands, I avoided this bug, by 
just showing the error for the user. Sadly, after some coding, I have created even more, for 
example, code examples did not have “TAB” space, and replacing the “span” tag with “pre” one 
would give a lot more work, so I did a different thing and added “&nbsp;” command, which 
creates extra space. <br>

Most of the bugs have appeared, because of some silly mistakes, but they have been corrected 
just by rechecking the code and adding some more lines.
